I focused on creating a responsive design that provides an optimal viewing experience across various devices. By leveraging CSS frameworks and techniques like Flexbox and Grid, I ensured that my website was not only visually appealing but also user-friendly.

The deployment process was another crucial phase of my learning. I chose Vercel for its seamless integration with frontend frameworks like React. Setting up the project on Vercel was straightforward, allowing me to deploy my site with just a few clicks.

Throughout this process, I learned valuable lessons about problem-solving and debugging, especially when faced with issues related to responsive behavior. I also gained insights into best practices for web development, including version control with Git and effective deployment strategies.

💡In conclusion, my journey in building and deploying a responsive website using React and Vite has been instrumental in advancing my skills in web development. This experience has provided a solid foundation for understanding application life cycles, which is critical for implementing effective CI/CD practices.
