I focused on creating a responsive design that provides an optimal viewing experience across various devices. By leveraging CSS frameworks and techniques like Flexbox and Grid, I ensured that my website was not only visually appealing but also user-friendly.

The deployment process was another crucial phase of my learning. I chose Vercel for its seamless integration with frontend frameworks like React. Setting up the project on Vercel was straightforward, allowing me to deploy my site with just a few clicks.

Throughout this process, I learned valuable lessons about problem-solving and debugging, especially when faced with issues related to responsive behavior. I also gained insights into best practices for web development, including version control with Git and effective deployment strategies.

ðŸ’¡In conclusion, my journey in building and deploying a responsive website using React and Vite has been instrumental in advancing my skills in web development. This experience has provided a solid foundation for understanding application life cycles, which is critical for implementing effective CI/CD practices.



### Version 1.1

In version 1.1 of this portfolio project, the focus is on enhancing the interactivity and functionality of the website. The key improvements include:

1. **Social Media Integration**:
   - Adding functional links to social media icons, allowing users to directly connect with relevant platforms.

2. **Contact Form Implementation**:
   - Connecting the contact form to a backend or database to allow form submissions.
   - Ensuring form validation for proper data input and user experience.

3. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Refining the design and layout for a better user interface, improving scrolling effects and responsiveness across devices.

4. **Backend Integration**:
   - Setting up a basic backend to handle form data (e.g., Node.js/Express or a serverless function).
   - Possibly integrating with a database (e.g., MongoDB or another service) for storing form submissions.

5. **Version Control & Deployment**:
   - Utilizing the staging branch for incremental updates and testing new features before pushing to production.
   - Continuously deploying the staging branch via Vercel to preview and test functionalities before merging into the main branch.

**Learning Objectives:**
   - Practicing backend and database integration for form handling.
   - Improving knowledge of deployment strategies and handling multiple environments (staging vs. production).
